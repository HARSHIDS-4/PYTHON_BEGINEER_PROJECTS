## 📌 Features

- Addition ➕
- Subtraction ➖
- Multiplication ✖
- Division ➗ (with validation)
- Handles invalid operator input with a default case.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10 or above (for `match-case` support)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository (or copy the file to your local machine).  

2. Open terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
    ```

---

## 🎯 Example Run:
    ``` 
    Enter two numbers and choose an operator (+, -, *, /).
    enter the first number: 10
    enter the second number: 5
    enter the operator(+,-,*,/): *
    multiplication of 2 numbers is: 50
    ```

## 📚 Skills Practiced

- Python Input/Output
- Conditional logic (match-case)
- Arithmetic operations
- Error handling concepts

## 📝 Notes

- Division by zero will currently throw an error (can be improved).
- Can be extended with:
    - Power (**)
    - Modulus (%)
    - Floor division (//)
    -Square roots, trigonometric functions, etc.
